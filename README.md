Sydney Water Security Risk Management Dashboards
This repository showcases two pivotal Power BI dashboards developed for Sydney Water's Security Risk Department: the Risk Assessment Scheduling Report and the Security Risk Reporting dashboard. These tools were designed to transform manual, Excel-based data processes into automated, insightful visualizations for enhanced security risk management. The Risk Assessment Scheduling Report provides an overview of planned and in-progress assessments, while the Security Risk Reporting dashboard deep dives into identified risks and control effectiveness.
